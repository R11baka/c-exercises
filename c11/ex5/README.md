#  One-dimensional cellular automaton.
In this assignment you will write two programs to simulate a simple one-dimensional cellular automaton.
These automata are related to (but are not the same as) two-dimensional cellular automata like Conwayâ€™s game of Life. We will use this example to introduce pointers and pointer arithmetic, as well as dynamic memory allocation. Pointers are one of the most confusing topics in C, so we will spend a lot of time discussing them before we get to the program you have to write.
